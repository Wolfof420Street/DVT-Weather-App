## dvt_weather_app
This Flutter project is an advanced weather application that leverages the robust features of Flutter to deliver a high-quality user experience. The application is structured using modern development practices, ensuring both reliability and maintainability.

## Architecture and Design
The app is built on a clean architecture that separates concerns and enhances the scalability of the project. Key components include:

- ViewModel Class: Implements the ChangeNotifier for state management. It acts as an intermediate layer between the UI and the business logic, facilitating a reactive data flow.
- Service Class: Contains the business logic of the application. This class is responsible for data fetching, processing, and handling business rules.
- UI Layer: Designed with user experience in mind, the UI layer is both responsive and intuitive, providing a seamless interaction with the app's features.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Mockito & Build Runner: Used for comprehensive unit and widget testing. Mockito allows mocking dependencies, while Build Runner automates code generation for tests.
- Continuous Integration Workflow: The project includes a CI workflow that automates tests and builds. It ensures that every commit passes the necessary checks before merging.

## Third-Party Libraries
The project uses several third-party libraries for enhanced functionality:

Dio: A powerful HTTP client for Dart, used for network requests.
Flutter Test: Provides testing utilities for Flutter apps.
Mockito: Used for creating mock objects in Dart.
Build Runner: Automates the generation of files from Dart code.
Provider: A state management solution that is used along with ChangeNotifier for managing app state.
